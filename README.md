# Secure-Coding-Project

# Project Description
This project is my first time experimenting with secure coding principles, and it was a blast! I had so much fun venturing into the cyber security side of my studies in HTU in this class.

This project was a part of my final project for my (Secure Coding) class, wehre we learned more about the security principles that can be applied in buidling softwares and maintaning them, for our final project we were given the freedom to choose our own way of expressing what we learned via following certain requirments ofcourse, therefore I choose to build a website that followed all of the security principles that I wished to discover and apply

# Screenshots of the applied security measures in my website:
(Note: Due to privacy reasons I am unable to share my code publicly where I applied all of the mentioned principles, but if you are a recuriter who is curious to understand my process, please dont hesistate in reaching out to me on ahmadaljurf1234@gmail.com for more snippets of the code)
